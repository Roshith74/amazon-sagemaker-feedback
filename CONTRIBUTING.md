# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the Issues to report bugs or suggest features.

If you're suggesting a new feature (i.e., functionality that doesn't exist yet), please use our issue template. This will prompt you to answer a few questions that will help us figure out what you're looking for. This gives us a way to filter the community-opened issues quickly so we can review as a team.

If you want to see the list of proposed features, you can see the view [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-feedback/labels/feature-request).

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-feedback/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-feedback/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. 

If you find that the issue already exists, we strongly encourage you to vote on issues, as it helps us understand which issues will have the widest impact, but please don't leave comments saying "+1". Such comments generate noise for people receiving notifications, and issues can't be sorted by number of "+1" comments. Instead, leave a üëç reaction, which is less noisy and can be used to sort issues for prioritization. To leave a reaction, navigate to the issue details page and add a reaction with the üòÄ button on the post. We want you to help us decide which items will benefit you the most. 

If you are requesting a new issue, please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:
* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of the product being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
