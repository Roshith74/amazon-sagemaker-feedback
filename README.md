## Amazon SageMaker Public Feedback Dashboard

This is a public dashboard for Amazon SageMaker where you can raise issues, request features and ask questions. Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service provided by Amazon Web Services. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build, train, tune, and deploy machine learning models at scale. To get started, visit [aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

## Introduction
This is an experimental public dashboard for SageMaker where you can raise issues, request features and ask questions.  We want to work closely with you to shape the future of our product and your feedback will be invaluable as we plan upcoming features and map out the product roadmap. By working together, we can ensure we are focused on solving the most pressing issues that will have the greatest impact. We will keep you updated on the progress and you can track our work here - [amazon-sagemaker-feedback-tracker](https://github.com/orgs/aws/projects/160). We will continue to improve how we manage and organize this dashboard over time, based on input from customers that engage in it.

## FAQs
**1) Why did you build this?**

We want our users to play an active role in shaping the future of our product. Gaining insights into the key challenges you face will be invaluable as we work to prioritize upcoming features and plan our roadmap. Through collaboration, we can ensure our development efforts are focused on addressing issues that truly matter. 

**2) Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

Because our main priority is security and operational stability, we cannot provide specific target dates for releases. 

**3) Is everything on the roadmap?**

This is an experimental public roadmap for SageMaker, which currently focuses only on customer feedback. It is not intended to include everything we are working on. There will always be features and products that we are very excited about that we are going to launch without notice to surprise and delight our customers. We will continue to improve how we manage and organize this roadmap over time, based on input from customers that engage in it.

**4) Will you build everything here?**

We intend to investigate all issues and feature requests, however we can't commit to delivering any feature or in any specific timeline. Roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

**5) What do roadmap categories mean?**

* *Shipped* - currently usable in SageMaker.
*	*Coming soon* - nearing completion. Think a couple of months out.
*	*We're working on it* - in progress, but further out. We might still be working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.
* *Researching* - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still evaluating designs and options, or thinking through how this should work.

**6) How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

Please create an issue! All submitted issues will get reviewed and/or forwarded appropriately. When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can.

**7) How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

We encourage you to open an issue, even if you‚Äôve requested it before via other channels. All community-submitted issues will be reviewed by the roadmap maintainers. We‚Äôve created a template to make it easy to open new issues. When filing a request, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can.

**8) Can I "+1" existing issues?**

If you find that someone has already reported a similar issue or requested a feature, we strongly encourage you to vote for it. This helps us prioritize issues with the widest impact. Please don't leave comments saying "+1" as such comments generate noise for people receiving notifications, and issues can't be sorted by number of "+1" comments. Instead, leave a üëç reaction that can be used to sort issues for prioritization. To leave a reaction, navigate to the issue details page and add a reaction with the üòÄ button on the post. We want you to help us decide which items will benefit you the most.

**9) Will you accept a pull request?**

We haven't worked out how pull requests should work for a public feedback page, but we will take all PRs very seriously and review for inclusion.
